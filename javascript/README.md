# Interview Problems - JavaScript

Interview Problems for Software Developer job posting.

## Introduction

Complete as many problems as you can within one hour.
There are six total problems, but it is OK if you do not complete all of them.
If you are stuck on a problem, you may skip it and move on.

Your proctor will be watching a mirror of your screen as you work.
Your proctor cannot help you solve the problem but is able to answer
questions about your development environment or the problem itself.

You may use the internet as a reference, but you should not look up the solution
to a problem directly.
(e.g. It is OK to look up "how to parse an int in JavaScript"
but it is not OK to look up "algorithm to find longest string in an array")

## Getting Started

Open the folder and run `yarn` in the console to install dependencies.

For each problem, complete the function in the file.
To test your solutions run `yarn testN` where `N` is the problem number that your are testing.
(e.g. For problem 1, run `yarn test1`.)

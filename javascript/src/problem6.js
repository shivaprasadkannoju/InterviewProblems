/**
 * Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter.
 * The function should return a collection of arrays representing two sides of the original array -
 * split at the equilibrium point such that the sum of both arrays is equal.
 * For the purposes of this exercise,
 * you may assume that there will always be an equilibrium point in the provided array.
 *
 * To test your solution, run `yarn test6` in the console.
 *
 * @param {number[]} numbers An array of numbers that contains an equilibrium point.
 * You may assume that there will always be an equilibrium point in the provided array.
 * @returns {number[][]} A collection of arrays representing two sides of the original array.
 * Both sides can be summed to get the same number.
 * @example createEquilibriumArrays([1, 2, 3]);  // [[1, 2], [3]]
 * @example createEquilibriumArrays([2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7]); // [[2, 3, 1, 5], [4, 7]]
